# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: Feb 2, 2018, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Created Python script to connect to the DB and print the results for the FSND project. Ready for submission tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: How do I make the queries faster? It takes between 20 - 30 seconds for the first two queries.

### Day 2: Feb 1, 2018, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Solved parts 2 and 3 of the Udacity FSND Log Analytics project. Also reviewed 3 sections of Lesson 3 - Building Layouts Part 2 of the Android basics course.

**Thoughts**: Created multiple views to help get the answers and had to do some Google searches for formatting and timestamp operations.

### Day 1: Jan 31, 2018, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Setup the psql DB for the Udacity FSND Log Analytics project. Did some test queries to get/review data, created a view and solved the first part of the project using the DB query.

**Thoughts**: I had to recollect/review/do google search for some of the syntax and also had to review the Udacity forum for some help with the syntax and example queries.
