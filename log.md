# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 31, 2018, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Setup the psql DB for the Udacity FSND Log Analytics project. Did some test queries to get/review data, created a view and solved the first part of the project using the DB query.

**Thoughts**: I had to recollect/review/do google search for some of the syntax and also had to review the Udacity forum for some help with the syntax and example queries.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
