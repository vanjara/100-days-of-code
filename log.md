# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: Feb 6, 2018, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Switching from full stack to Android today for a change - learning about LinearLayouts, orientation, layout_height, layout_width and layout_weights.

**Thoughts**: Was tricky today to continue the coding. Had to stretch and do it around 11 pm and so decided to do Android instead of web server.

### Day 6: Feb 5, 2018, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Additional work with SQLAlchemy and doing the Udacity exercises. Started the Making a web server lesson and followed the code examples.

**Thoughts**: It will be interesting to associate GET/POST with CRUD

### Day 4: Feb 4, 2018, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Learning about CRUD, ORM, SQLAlchemy and doing some practice examples to learn more about SQLAlchemy.

**Thoughts**: DB operations should be interesting. The lessons seems doable but wondering how the catalog item project would be.

### Day 4: Feb 3, 2018, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: **Completed the Log Analytics Project** (cleaned up the code, added some timer functionality and created the README.md). Project submitted and successfully reviewed. Also made some of the suggested changes.

**Thoughts**: Completing the project feels great. It was not as difficult as I thought it would be.

### Day 3: Feb 2, 2018, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Created Python script to connect to the DB and print the results for the FSND project. Ready for submission tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: How do I make the queries faster? It takes between 20 - 30 seconds for the first two queries.

### Day 2: Feb 1, 2018, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Solved parts 2 and 3 of the Udacity FSND Log Analytics project. Also reviewed 3 sections of Lesson 3 - Building Layouts Part 2 of the Android basics course.

**Thoughts**: Created multiple views to help get the answers and had to do some Google searches for formatting and timestamp operations.

### Day 1: Jan 31, 2018, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Setup the psql DB for the Udacity FSND Log Analytics project. Did some test queries to get/review data, created a view and solved the first part of the project using the DB query.

**Thoughts**: I had to recollect/review/do google search for some of the syntax and also had to review the Udacity forum for some help with the syntax and example queries.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
